               <p> 
                  Passionate about technology, I always try to learn and be
                  on top of the news to create modern and advanced applications.
                  I completed my graduation in the 1st semester of 2021, which I finished early. During the course, I performed internships
                  in different areas from beginning of course to end, to know for sure
                  which area would follow.
               </p>
               <p>
                  I've had the opportunity to go through some companies,
                  working mainly with web development.
                  I worked with several platforms, working as much as
                  full stack and as part of a team.
                  Today, I am a junior developer.
